# Timeline Website

This is a simple vertical timeline website built with SvelteKit and Supabase. The timeline animates as the user scrolls down the page, with elements appearing on both the left and right sides of the line in an alternating style. Each element has a title, description, date, and an icon that describes its use.

## Tech Stack

- SvelteKit
- Supabase for database

## Design

The design is clean and simple, with a two-color theme system that users can switch between.

## Local Development Setup

Follow these steps to set up the development environment locally:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

2. Navigate to the project directory.

```bash
cd timeline-website
```

3. Install the necessary dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

4. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add your Supabase URL and public anon key.

```bash
SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
```

5. Start the development server.

```bash
npm run dev
```

Now, you can open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` to see the application running.

## Note

If you encounter an error related to npm not being able to find a file, ensure that you are in the correct directory where `package.json` is located.
